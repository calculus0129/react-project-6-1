# react-project-6-1

A demo project for using redux in react.

## Branch Descriptions

- `demo`: A demonstration code of using redux in a javascript application.
- `wo-reduxToolkit`: A react application (of create-react-app) with plain `react-redux`'s state management.
- `prev-reduxToolkit`: The extended react application whose state is managed by `@reduxjs/toolkit` library.
- `remake`: A remade version of `demo`.
- `next-plain-redux`: A remade version of `wo-reduxToolkit` (made via next.js and typescript).
- `next-ts-reduxtoolkit`: A remade version of `prev-reduxToolkit`.

The `main` branch currently (on 25/02/02) has the same content with the `next-ts-reduxtoolkit` except for the documentation.
